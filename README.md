# Calculator

This a simple calculator, made to have basic and helpful operations for all users.

It contains the four main operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division signs. 

The additional buttons found on the calculator are the save, paste, and clear buttons. Just as their names propose, their purposes are the same. 

- The save button will save the current number which you have on your screen.
- The paste button will paste the current number saved in its history and override whichever other number you had.
- The clear button resets the number you see on the screen to zero and resets the operation to the most recently used one (if none were used, addition is the default operation).
